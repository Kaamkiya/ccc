ccc
===

Solutions to the problems from the Canadian Computing Competition from over the
years.

Note to people who see this: if you've come here for solutions, keep looking. I
have only done one problem. One.

You can find information about the CCC at

How this repo is structured
---------------------------

The first subdirectory is either the senior (sr) or junior (jr) competition.
The second subdirectory is the year (eg, 2024).
The third is the language (eg, py).
And finally, the files are the letter s and the problem number (eg, s2).

Languages
---------
I will do these in Python, C, probably Java, and maybe Lua too. Note though,
the CCC does not accept Lua solutions.
